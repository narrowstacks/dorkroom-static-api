# Dorkroom Static API

A comprehensive static API for analog film photography data, including film stocks, developers, development combinations, and formats.

## Data Structure

This repository contains four main JSON files that provide structured data for analog photography applications:

> **Important:** The database uses UUID-based identifiers. All references between files (e.g., film_stock_id, developer_id) use UUIDs.

### `film_stocks.json`

Contains detailed information about film stocks from various manufacturers.

**Structure:**

```json

### Data Sources

When adding new data, please use reliable sources such as:

- Official manufacturer specifications, such as datasheets.
- Reputable photography publications
- Film photography community databases
- Personal testing results (clearly marked as such)

**Please do NOT add data directly from the Massive Development Chart, as they specifically do not allow reproducing their data.**

If your development time is identical or similar to one on their list, that's okay! Development data isn't inherently theirs. Just don't copy their data/notes/etc verbatim.
