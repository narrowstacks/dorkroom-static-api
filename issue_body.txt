### Notes

ILFORD ILFOTEC LC29 is a high dilution liquid concentrate black and white film developer that is flexible and
economic to use. It is based on the technology used in ILFORD ILFOTEC HC developer but is formulated to be
an easy to pour liquid for small volume film processing

### Mixing Instructions

Determine first either the tank size being used or the number of films to be processed and measure out the
appropriate quantity of concentrate. Always use the smallest measuring cylinder available; it is easier to
measure 10ml accurately in a 50ml cylinder than in a 500ml cylinder.
Add the concentrate to the mixing vessel. A large measuring jug is a good mixing vessel as it provides a
check on the total quantity of solution mixed. Rinse out the measuring cylinder used for the concentrate
into the mixing vessel. Finally add hot and cold water to make up the final volume at the desired temperature
and stir thoroughly.
As most water drawn from pressure mains is highly aerated, we advise that users draw off the water they
need and leave it to stand for a few minutes before using it to make up developers.
