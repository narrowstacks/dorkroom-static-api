Super Fine-Σ Grain Technology is employed to deliver the distinct tight grain structure and alignment along with high acutance and smooth tonal rendering to suit both scanning and enlarging applications. Its medium-speed ISO 100 nominal sensitivity suits working in a variety of outdoor conditions and enhanced reciprocity characteristics also benefit working with longer exposure times. Additionally, Acros II incorporates P.I.D.C. Technology (Precision Iodine Distribution Control), which provides stable processing results when manually developing the film in small tanks or automatically in larger processors.",

It has a medium-speed nominal sensitivity of ISO 100/21° when developed in E-6 process and the smooth grain profile pairs with a micro-structure optimized T-GRAIN emulsion to make it especially well-suited to scanning applications.",
